### Hi there 👋

I create value by enabling researchers to focus on optimizing their algorithms by managing the technical debt surrounding their systems.

I've 5+ years of experience building deep learning systems in areas like art, language, and perception. I've held leadership positions in large-scale startups like Snapdeal, PipeCandy and was recently founding engineer, technical architect @ KloudOne, managing clients like Broadcom, Cinarra, CA Technologies, RiskSense, Symantec, and Accuknox.

I'm comfortable operating in teams and working independently with minimal oversight across different functional units developing a high tolerance for ambiguity and always ready to roll up my sleeves.

I believe there are many problems in the world that software could play a significant role in making life safer and faster for people to get things done. I tend to see the world as a web of relations in that there are no limits to what people with different strengths and perspectives can create together.

I also spend time writing my views on engineering, martial arts, history, philosophy, and religion
