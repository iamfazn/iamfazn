## Senior Software Engineer

I collaborate with research scientists to implement and evaluate machine learning algorithms. Go-to person for the team to build/scale infrastructure and tools for research teams

I've 5+ years of experience architecting and implement software libraries for research prototypes across the range of deep learning based projects in areas like language, and perception.

I'm comfortable operating in teams and working independently with minimal oversight across different functional units developing a high tolerance for ambiguity and always ready to roll up my sleeves.

I believe there are many problems in the world that software could play a significant role in making life safer and faster for people to get things done. I tend to see the world as a web of relations in that there are no limits to what people with different strengths and perspectives can create together
