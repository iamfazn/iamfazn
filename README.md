## Senior Software Engineer

I'm Fauzan, currently an engineer at Cisco. I collaborate with research scientists to implement and evaluate machine learning algorithms. I love architecting and implement software libraries for research prototypes across the range of deep learning based projects in areas like language, and perception.
