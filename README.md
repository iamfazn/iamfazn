### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've 5+ years of experience building distributed, deep learning systems in areas like search, natural language processing, and computer vision.

I'm comfortable operating in teams and working independently with minimal oversight across different functional units developing a high tolerance for ambiguity and always ready to roll up my sleeves.

I believe there are many problems in the world that software could play a significant role in making life safer and faster for people to get things done. I tend to see the world as a web of relations and there are no limits to what people with different strengths and perspectives can create together

I also spend time writing my views on engineering, tech leadership, and software industry in general
